function fnames = filenames_standard_filesystem(bd,site,type,ts,mf,msf,tf)
% FILENAMES_STANDARD_FILESYSTEM - generates a set of filenames in the
% standard SITES/TYPE/YYYY_MM/ directory hierarchy.
%
% Usage: fnames = filenames_standard_filesystem( baseDir, site, type,
%                                   TimeStamps, monthflag, ,monthseperatorflag
%                                   typeflag )
%
% Inputs
% ------
% baseDir = base of directory hierarchy
% site = a cell array of site names
% type = a cell array of RDL types
% TimeStamps = an array of time stamps in datenum format
% monthflag = boolean indicating whether or not to include the YYYY_MM
%             directory
% monthseperatorflag = boolean indicating whether a _ or - are used to seperate the
%            the YYYY and MM
% typeflag = boolean indicating whether or not to include the type in the
%            directory (defaults to true)
% 
% NOTE: baseDir, site, type and TimeStamps can all have different sizes and
% shapes.  Things will be resized using repmat so that they are the same
% size before generating filenames and loading in files.  Typically, one
% would want site and type to be row vectors of the same size and TimeStamps
% to be a column vector.  This will load in all combinations of the
% site+types with all timestamps.
%
% Outputs
% -------
% fnames = cell array of filenames.  Will always be a cell array, even if
%          there is just one.
